// DECISION MAKING = (boolean logic)
    // Comparisons: compare value wether number or string(unicodes) ect..
        //  >/< Greater Than and Less Than Ex. 1 > 3 = false \ 1 < 3 = true
        // >=/<= Greater Than or Equal to and less Than or Equal to Ex. 1 <= 1 = true
        // == Equality: checks if values match regardless of data type
            // will defult to making value into same data type to compare
            // may result in unexpected/odd output 
                // Ex. 1 =="1" = true (gives us true but true value is not the same one is a int other a str)
                // Ex. 0 == " " = true / 0 == false = true (gives true but really isent the same value)
                // 

        // === Strictly Equality: works just like equality BUT CHECKS DATA TYPES
            // Ex. 1 === "1" = false but 1 === 1 = true (flse due to type laso other true due to type)
            // 
            // 
            // 
            // 
        // != Not Equality: operats same as equality but in reverse- this one looking if it dosent match
            // just like equlity Data Type is ignored
            // Ex. 1 != 2 = true / 1 != 1 = false / 1 != "1" = false (dosent care about type)

        // !== Strcit Not Equality: operats just like srict equality but in reverse
            // looking for non matches and Does take into consideration Data Types
            // Ex. 1 !== 2 = true / 1 !== 1 = false  / 1 !== "1" = true
            // -- (results similar to euqlity ex. but diff in last ex. due to data type consideration)






// NOTE - when wanting to compare thing use the strict properties non-strict one less common
